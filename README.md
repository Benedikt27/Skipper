About the Skipper

The Skipper is a brand new tool made by Bene27 in which helpers and above have the ability to add or subtract skips from an individual’s profile on Hammy’s housing. Using this tool, staff members can view one’s profile to see if he or she has a sufficient amount of skips left.

Installation

For Windows:

Run the skipper.jar file.
If the file is not running, run the checkversion.bat file to view your Java version.

If you do not have Java 8, launch the SkipperInstaller.exe file and go through the installation process there.
If you do have Java 8, run the file again, and if it doesn’t work, private message Bene27 on Discord.

For Mac:
Run the Skipper.jar file.
If the file does not open, install Java 8 manually on this website and run the file again.










Using the Skipper

First Login:
When you first launch the skipper tool, you will be brought up to a screen in which to input your Minecraft username. After doing so, you will need to set your password. Passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure your password is stored away safely or can be easily remembered by only you.


Skipping Someone:
In order to add a skip onto someone’s profile:
Enter their Minecraft username in the box (not case-sensitive, so lower and uppercase do not matter) and press the “Check User” button.                   
Press the “Skip” button to add one skip to the profile you brought up.   
If you accidentally added a skip, you can remove it by pressing “Remove Skip”
To exit the profile, simply delete the name in the box and start the process over again.

Logging Out:
To logout, press the “Logout” button and close the window.

If you have any problems or want to report a bug, please message Bene27#0740 on Discord.
